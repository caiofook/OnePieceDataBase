# OnePieceDataBase
## One Piece's characters data base for purposes of learning java's spring boot framework and data manipulation with PostgreSQL

This is a simple API for learning purposes. I just made a REST API using SpringBoot and integrated the application with a PostgreSQL data base, as seen in the amigoscode / freecodecamp's tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtPkZShrvXQ&t=4277s .

The Database contains some characters of the anime and initialy it only contains one class named "pirate". At the time of the first commit, only exists one class, and each pirate has only two attributes: "id" and "name". 

I pretend to add two more classes: "akumanomi" and "crew", as well as more attributes for the pirates ("crew", "powers", "speciallities", "akumaNoMiUser?", "captain?"). Afterwards, the idea is to create relations between the objects of these three different classes. Every pirate belongs to a crew, and some of them are akuma no mi users.
